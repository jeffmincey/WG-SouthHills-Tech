==================

We've put together a brief video tutorial on how to setup Realizzer with Vista. 
But first you need to install the demos of [Realizzer](http://www.realizzer.com/index.php/downloads/category/1-software?download=1:realizzer-setup) and [Vista](http://jands.com/vistapublic/Byron_Windows_Installer-2.2.12560.zip).

After you get those two installed, here is the latest Vista Show file and Realizzer config using the [Download ZIP](https://github.com/jeffmincey/WG-SouthHills-Tech/archive/master.zip) button on the right.

Now you're ready to watch the [demo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8APbFBd-0TOFBxbkZ0TTZLeUk&authuser=0)
